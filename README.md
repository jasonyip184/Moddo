# Moddo
Ever experienced a situation where you are unsure of what modules to take, or what combination will make an ideal one? Moddo aims to solve this dilemma.

Moddo is a web application that uses a simple recommender system to suggest modules to take for your next semester. It is developed with R using mainly the Shiny package and also other packages to do some simple styling and design with HTML/CSS on the frontend. On the backend, it relies on R to do the data processing and server logic. I used googlesheets as a "database" to pull and push modules based on the user's module inputs. This list of modules was obtained from api.nusmods.com and the background image was obtained from http://blog.nus.edu.sg/provost/2013/01/17/edusports-complex-at-university-town/

Moddo is hugely limited by the number of people who use it / the number of entries in the database and hence it could only be effective with a very large sample size. It could be used by students of NUS to have a better sensing of what modules to take based on what their seniors have taken. For example, knowing what modules most people from your major take for Unrestricted Electives or General Education Modules or core/non-core ratio could be useful as well.

This is my first project ever and I hope to learn a lot more from the community. Please send any feedback or advise regarding anything to jasonyip184@gmail.com
